###Do you have a text editor installed?

Any of the ones listed below is fine.
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io)
- [Atom] (https://atom.io/)
- [Visual studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/)

If you have no experience or preference when it comes to working with text editor just install Brackets, you can always switch to another editor later on in the program.
